# 📝 ThinkBoard – MERN Stack Notes Application

ThinkBoard is a full-stack MERN application that allows users to create, view, and manage notes in a simple and user-friendly interface. The project was developed step-by-step following industry-style backend-first architecture and then integrating a React-based frontend.

This project demonstrates my understanding of backend API development, database integration, frontend UI creation, and full-stack communication.

## 🧩 Project Development Workflow

### 1️⃣ Setting Up Backend & Basics
- Initialized Node.js project using npm  
- Installed core dependencies such as Express and Mongoose  
- Created main server file and configured basic server setup  
- Verified server working using simple API test

### 2️⃣ Nodemon & Setting Up Routes
- Installed Nodemon for automatic server restart  
- Created routes folder to handle API endpoints  
- Designed RESTful routes for notes  
- Tested routes using browser and Postman

### 3️⃣ Optimizing File & Folder Structure
- Organized backend into meaningful folders:
  - models → database schemas  
  - controllers → business logic  
  - routes → API endpoints  
  - config → database configuration  
- Improved readability and maintainability

### 4️⃣ Setting Up Database (MongoDB)
- Connected MongoDB using Mongoose  
- Created Note schema with fields like title and content  
- Verified database connection successfully

### 5️⃣ Completing Controllers
- Implemented controller functions for:
  - Creating a new note  
  - Fetching all notes  
  - Fetching a single note  
  - Deleting a note  
- Used async/await and proper error handling

### 6️⃣ Middleware & Rate Limiting
- Added middleware for JSON parsing  
- Implemented rate limiting to prevent excessive requests  
- Improved application security and performance

### 7️⃣ Frontend Setup – React.js
- Created React application  
- Organized components folder  
- Installed required packages  
- Setup base layout and routing

### 8️⃣ Home Page
- Displayed list of all notes  
- Fetched notes from backend using API calls  
- Designed clean and simple UI

### 9️⃣ Create Page
- Built form for creating new notes  
- Connected form with backend API  
- Display success behavior after note creation

### 🔟 Delete Functionality
- Added delete button for each note  
- Connected delete API  
- Instantly removed deleted note from UI

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Note Detail Page
- Created page for viewing individual note  
- Fetch note by ID  
- Display full note information
